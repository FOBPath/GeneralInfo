## Overview

Description
An app designed to help Computer Science and Engineering majors find job opportunities tailored to their specific fields. The app features intuitive navigation, a scrollable job feed, saved jobs functionality, and external links to job applications.

App Evaluation

Category: Job Search / Professional Networking
Mobile:
Story:The app addresses the pain point of finding tech-specific job opportunities among general listings. It tailors the job search experience to CS and Engineering students, making it easier to find relevant roles, internships, and networking events.
Market: The primary market is CS and Engineering students from colleges and universities. Recent graduates and professionals seeking entry-level jobs and internships could also benefit. Partnering with tech companies to post jobs directly on the platform is a potential monetization strategy.
Habit:Users will likely check the app multiple times daily during job hunts or internship searches. Push notifications for job postings, deadlines, or saved job updates increase engagement.
Scope:V1 will focus on job listings, job searches, and saved job functionality. V2 could add personalized recommendations, user profiles with portfolios, and job application tracking. V3 could incorporate features like networking opportunities, company reviews, and salary insights.
